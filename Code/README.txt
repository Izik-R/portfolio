# Launch the atomapi.py and follow the prompts in the terminal.

# This file will have previously used 'final' products so you're able to see progression in the code over time.

# The files recorded in the folder used to all work together, and create 2 CSV files. I will leave outdated programs in the folder to show progression of the code. 

# CSV files are for a crypto asset Cosmos ($ATOM). For API info please see the API_INFO.txt file in this repository

	-Price Data (Marketcap and Token Price): A way to judge sentiment, lows, highs, averages, and chart patterns.
	-Transaction Fees: Value collected from operations with the $ATOM token
